Seems like I need to learn how to use GitHub if I want to really become a developer

I am a civil engineer who has recently come to terms with the realization that I am not happy in this field. Somehow, it took me this long to realize that programming is what I really enjoy. I don't know what type of programmer I'll be, but I'm not interested in taking whichever path is easiest for me to understand at first. I am ready to commit to something I really enjoy that will challenge me. Let's see what GitHub can do to be the next step in this journey.
